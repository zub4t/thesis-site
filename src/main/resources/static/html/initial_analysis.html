                        <p>Before working with the data, it's essential to perform an initial phase to discover the bias
                            in the measurements. Bias can arise from various sources, such as hardware limitations,
                            environmental factors, or the data collection process itself. Identifying and addressing
                            bias is crucial to ensure accurate and reliable results.</p>
                        <p>There are several methods for discovering bias, such as comparing the captured data with
                            ground truth measurements or using statistical techniques to analyze the data distribution.
                            Once bias is identified, it can be corrected through various methods, such as calibration or
                            normalization.</p>
                        <p>In our case we compare the captured data with ground truth measurements. For
                            example, the figure below shows the distance vs. ground truth for a set of measurements. The
                            purple line represents a perfect match between the measurements and ground truth, while the
                            red line represents the least mean squares (LMS) regression line that minimizes the
                            difference between the measurements and the 'predict' values by the line. The difference between these lines
                            represents the bias in the measurements.</p>

                        <p>By taking the time to discover and correct bias in the measurements, we can ensure that our
                            data is accurate and reliable, which is essential for any further analysis or
                            applications.</p>

                        <h2 class="mb-5">Calculating User Localization</h2>
                        <p>Once the bias in the measurements has been identified and corrected, we can use the data to
                            calculate the user's localization. There are several methods for calculating user
                            localization, such as gradient descent and Bayesian grid update.</p>
                        <h3 class="mt-5">Gradient Descent</h3>
                        <p>Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that minimizes a function by iteratively
                            adjusting the input parameters. In the context of user localization, we can use gradient
                            descent to minimize the error between the measured distances and the distances predicted by
                            a model of the environment. By iteratively adjusting the user's position, we can converge on
                            an estimate of their location.</p>
                        <p>One challenge with gradient descent is that it can get stuck in local minima, which are
                            suboptimal solutions that are not the global minimum. To address this, we can use techniques
                            such as simulated annealing or particle swarm optimization to explore the search space more
                            effectively.</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-5">Bayesian Grid Update</h3>
                        <p>Bayesian grid update is a method for estimating the probability distribution of the user's
                            location based on the observed data. This method uses Bayesian inference to update the
                            probability distribution as new data becomes available.</p>
                        <p>The basic idea behind Bayesian grid update is to divide the environment into a grid of cells
                            and assign a probability to each cell based on the likelihood of the observed data given the
                            cell. By updating the probabilities as new data is collected, we can converge on a
                            probability distribution that represents the user's location.</p>

                        <p>One of the challenges in user localization is selecting the best set of access points (APs) to use for position estimation. In some cases, using a subset of the available APs can result in a better estimate than using all of them. We are currently in the process of discovering how to select the best set of APs for a given environment.</p>
